A React Native Expo app that helps manage the products from a store.
The app let's you: 
1. Add completely new products or add new data for existing products (expiry dates, quantities, distributors).
2. See products depending on their expiry date (either products that expire in 24h or in the next 2 weeks).
3. See each of those expiring products individually, with more details.
4. Edit the details of the product you are seeing.
5. Implemented Barcode Scanner to make it easier when adding products.
6. Used Supabase for the database where i store the products.

App fully functional, working to add more things to it in the future.
